# Crime Type Prediction - Denver City

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting crime types in Denver using historical crime incident data. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter notebook environment, leveraging machine learning techniques to understand and predict crime patterns in the Denver metropolitan area.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the City and County of Denver's Open Data Catalog:
- Source: [Denver Crime Data](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-crime)
- Format: CSV file
- Contains detailed information about crime incidents in Denver, including:
  - Incident type
  - Date and time
  - Location
  - Neighborhood
  - And other relevant features
